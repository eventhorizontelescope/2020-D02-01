#Name of the science target(s) of the experiment.

#Science targets are typically weak sources which cannot be used for calibration tasks.
#If all observed targets can be set as some type of calibrator below, set science_target = None.

###   (same calibrator for instrumental phase and delay calibration and bandpass for example). ###
### Put None if a certain calibrator is not needed                                             ###

#Bright calibrators for instrumental phase and delay calibration.
calibrators_instrphase = 3C279

#Bright calibrators for complex bandpass calibration.
#If bandtype_cmplx_bandpass = 'BPOLY' is set in array.inp, only a single source can be set here,
#since POLY bandpasses cannot be averaged.

#Bright calibrators for rl delay and phase offsets.
#If set to None, the rl delay calibration will be skipped.

#Must be polarized and observed over a wide range of parallactic angles for every antenna.
#If set to None, the D-term calibration will be skipped.

#Phase-referencing sources.
#If set, the phase-referencing mode is activated.
#For a list of comma separated science_targets, use a corresponding csv list here.
#Example: science_target = s1, s2, s3 and calibrators_phaseref = p1, p2 means that
#p1 is used as phaseref source for s1, p2 is used for s2, and no phase-referencing is 
#done for s3.

#Whether or not to also fringe-fit the science targets themselves in phase-referencing mode.
#Set to False for very weak science targets, then only the fringe solutions from
#calibrators_phaseref are applied to the science targets.
#Set to True if the science targets are strong enough for a residual fringe-fit. In that case,
#after a transfer of fringe solutions from calibrators_phaseref, the science targets themselves
#are fringe-fitted as well, to take out residual phase/delays/rates.
#Generally, this should be False for astrometry. It should be True when the calibrator is far away
#from the science target and/or at higher frequency observations.
